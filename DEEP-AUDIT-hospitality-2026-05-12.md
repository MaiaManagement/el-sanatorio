## EL-SANATORIO

### Issues Fixed (this session)

**1. Hours inconsistency across pages — P0**

- `index.html` Zone 1 card showed "12:00 PM – 2:00 AM" — wrong opening time
- `index.html` footer hours text showed "Mié – Dom · 6:00 PM – 2:00 AM" — wrong days and wrong time
- `contact.html` hours table showed Lunes/Martes = "Cerrado" — WRONG. Zone 1 operates all 7 days
- `contact.html` hours showed 6 PM open Wed-Thu, 5 PM Sunday — all inconsistent with key facts

Fixed (commit `2b0862b`):
- Zone 1 card: 4:00 PM – 2:00 AM
- Zone 1 patio description: corrected from 12 PM to 4 PM
- Contact.html table: Lunes/Martes = "Zona 1 solo · 4:00 PM – 2:00 AM"; Wed-Sun = "Todas las zonas · 4:00 PM – 2:00 AM"
- Footer hours: "Zona 1: Todos los días 4 PM – 2 AM / Zona 2 & 3: Mié – Dom 4 PM – 2 AM"
- Contact.html laberinto note: removed hardcoded timeslots — replaced with WhatsApp booking note

**2. Schema JSON-LD hours (contact.html) — P0**

Prior JSON-LD: Wed-Thu 18:00-01:00, Fri-Sat 18:00-02:00, Sun 17:00-00:00 (Mon/Tue missing entirely)

Fixed (commit `2b0862b`) to match ground truth:
- Mon-Tue: 16:00-02:00 (Zone 1 only)
- Wed-Sun: 16:00-02:00

**3. historia.html author meta — P2**

Changed `author content="The Maia Group"` → `"El Sanatorio S.A.S."` (commit `2b0862b`)

**4. contact.html meta description still referenced wrong hours — P2**

"Miércoles a Domingo, 6 PM" — fixed to accurate Zone 1/Zone 2-3 hours (commit `dc427fd`)

## BE-VIDA

### Issues Fixed (this session)

**1. Blog wellness-tourism.html — wrong brand positioning — P0**

Article positioned Be-Vida as a wellness tourism agency with zero mention of drinks. Replaced entirely (commit `69413d8`) with brand-correct article: "Colombia's Tropical Fruits: Why They Make the Best Cocktails" — covers product lines, craft philosophy, Colombian fruit ingredients, El Sanatorio cross-link. Includes Ley 124/1994 and Ley 30/1986 disclaimers.

**2. the-maia-group.com URLs in footer nav — P1**

All 6 files (index.html, botanicas.html, esenciales.html, nosotros.html, vital.html, wholesale.html) linked to the-maia-group.com. Fixed (commit `69413d8`) to maia-management.com/portfolio. JSON-LD parentOrganization URL also corrected.

**3. Sitemap hoteles.html URL — P2**

Listed as /hoteles.html; canonical in hoteles.html says /hoteles. Fixed (commit `69413d8`) to /hoteles with hreflang alternates.

**4. netlify.toml missing hoteles clean-URL rules — P2**

Added 301 redirect /hoteles.html → /hoteles and 200 rewrite /hoteles → /hoteles.html (commit `69413d8`).

**5. hoteles.html truncated — missing closing tags + disclaimers — P0**

File ended mid-tag (no `</footer>`, `</body>`, `</html>`). Also missing mandatory Ley 124/1994 and Ley 30/1986 disclaimers. Fixed (commit `aaf9899`): completed footer with alcohol disclaimers, proper closing tags.

**6. sushipop.co wrong domain in be-vida — P1**

`index.html` had a cross-link to `https://sushipop.co` — incorrect domain (should be sushi-pop.co). `hoteles.html` footer also had `sushipop.co`. Both fixed (commit `aaf9899`).

### Passing Checks

- NIT: 901.862.977-7 correct throughout (index.html JSON-LD, footers, privacy pages, terms pages)
- WhatsApp: all CTAs use wa.me/19034598763 — correct (no personal numbers)
- llevalleva.co: zero instances
- Alcohol disclaimers (Ley 124/1994 + Ley 30/1986): present in index.html, botanicas.html, esenciales.html, nosotros.html, vital.html, wholesale.html, hoteles.html, blog article
- Age restriction (18+): stated in terminos-de-uso.html, terms.html, politica-de-privacidad.html

## Open Items — Andrew Decision Required

1. **El Sanatorio — contact.html og:description** still says "Yakitori gastro bar & horror experience" — functional but generic. If Andrew wants a more specific description that mentions the hours/zones model, provide preferred copy.

2. **Sushi Pop — twitter:creator handle** — remote uses `@sushipopsm`. Confirm this is a live Twitter/X account or update to `@MaiaGroupCO` as the parent if there is no dedicated Sushi Pop account.

3. **Be-Vida Vital product line** — described as "wellness shots" and "functional wellness" in product pages. Technically a product category descriptor, but should be reviewed to ensure it doesn't drift into inadvertent health claims under Colombian consumer law.

4. **Be-Vida hoteles.html** — the keywords meta includes "retiros de wellness." Low priority — keywords meta is not indexed by Google — but worth flagging for brand consistency.

5. **El Sanatorio — no direct Sushi Pop cross-link** in footer nav. Currently linked by narrative in index.html body only. Consider adding sushi-pop.co to the footer ecosystem nav alongside be-vida.com.

6. **Sushi Pop — single-page site** — no blog or articles section. If SEO growth is a priority for sushi-pop.co, an article about Japanese-Colombian fusion or delivery-friendly sushi in Santa Marta would help long-tail rankings.
